# Palette Pickr

Palette Pickr is a simple progressive web app for easily putting together color palettes. Based on the concept made popular by coolors.co, users are given a randomized set of 5 color swatches. Users can choose to lock or leave unlocked any of the swatches, and then hit the generate new colors button which will return new colors for the unlocked swatches. Once a color palette has been decided on, the user may save the palette to the current project. New projects containing their own sets of saved palettes can also be created.
